## Add Media 

Every piece of media that you use in your project is treated as its own page. To add media, select the **downward facing arrow** icon. There are multiple ways to add media in your Scalar project. 

# Upload media 

You can upload media files from your own computer; however, each file size must be less than than 2M in size. If your file is bigger than 2M than you will have to upload it to your own server first or link to it.

## Privacy

Please note that Scalar stores its [data](https://info.omeka.net/signup/privacy-policy/) in the United States. If you are asking students to create projects using Scalar, students should be made aware of this and given the option to make their work anonymous or to sign up without using personally identifying information. For more information on UBC privacy facts, read the [Privacy Fact Sheet on Collecting Personal Information](https://universitycounsel.ubc.ca/files/2020/01/Fact-Sheet-Collecting-Personal-Information.pdf).

Remember, students at UBC own their intellectual property so they have the right to refuse openly licensing their work. Itâ€™s necessary to communicate the risks and value of working in the open and/or public with your students. Librarians can help you with that!

## Accessibility

Accessibility is important. There are steps you can take to make sure you are making your project as accessible as possible. For example, if you are uploading multimedia content such as videos or sound clips, make sure you have included a transcription or provided a description. When uploading images to websites, you should include alt-text or captions. [Alt-text](https://moz.com/learn/seo/alt-text) provides a description of an image that can be read by a screen reader.
