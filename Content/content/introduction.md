# Introduction to Scalar

Scalar is a semantic digital publishing and exhibition platform that enables authors to create projects that emphasize and make use of different media resources. With minimal technical expertise, authors can create rich, visually-striking digital scholarship projects. Scalar enables authors to include media objects in their projects, link to media objects in institutional repositories, and to organize and present the online resources in a structured form. With Scalar, the author can organize pages and media resources in different ways that “take advantage of the unique capabilities of digital writing, including nested, recursive, and non-linear formats” (Scalar) to communicate and support the narrative of the project.

The Scalar platform was produced by The Alliance for Networking Visual Culture at the University of Southern California (USC).


## Digital Publishing and Pedagogy

Unlike traditional research paper assignments, digital publishing assignments provide students with the opportunity to create content that can potentially reach a wider audience. Digital books can be made publicly available and even licensed with a Creative Commons license that allows them to be reused, redistributed, and adapted by other scholars. 

Scalar has many built in features that make it ideal for digital and public pedagogy. For example, students can be added to a project as collaborators which means that students can work in groups or contribute to a project as a class. Scalar also integrates [hypothes.is] (http://hypothes.is/), an annotation features that enables students and the public to annotate the contents of your book, making it easy for peer-review, feedback, and class discussion. 

## Building a project with Scalar 

Scalar projects are composed of three main units: Media, Pages, and Paths.

Media can include videos, images, or documents. Each piece of media has its own URL. Media can be displayed by adding them to your pages. 

Pages are where you build your content. You can add text, multimedia, and add annotations.

Paths connect the pages of your book. They allow you to create a network of connections within your book (i.e. your book does not need to follow a linear path).
