## Digital Publishing with Scalar 

This workshop provides an introduction to Scalar, a free, open source authoring and publishing platform. Scalar can be used to create media rich assignments and open, digital books. Participants will learn how to build Scalar pages incorporating multimedia (e.g. video, text, images, sound), annotations, tags, and metadata.

This is a [UBC Library Research Commons workshop](https://researchcommons.library.ubc.ca). For more information about our [upcoming workshops](https://researchcommons.library.ubc.ca/events/) and to view [our open workshop content](https://researchcommons.library.ubc.ca/oer/) find us at https://researchcommons.library.ubc.ca.
