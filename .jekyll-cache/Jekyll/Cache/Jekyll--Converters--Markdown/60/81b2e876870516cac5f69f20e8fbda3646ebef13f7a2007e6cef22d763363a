<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<p>To begin working with Scalar, you will first need to create a book where you can add all your content including pages, media, and relationships.</p>

<p>Under <strong>My Books</strong>, add the title of your new book and select <strong>Create New Book</strong>, enter the title for your new book and select the <strong>Create* button</strong>. Your new book will appear under my Books.</p>

<p>Select the book you would like to edit from your drop-down menu.</p>

<p><strong>Book Properties</strong> contains various settings for the book. In Basics, add a Subtitle and Description for the project. The URI segment of the projectâ€™s web address can be edited. Table of Contents can be created once pages have been added to the book. In <strong>Style</strong>, ensure that the latest version, (Scalar 2) is selected. The rest of the Style settings can be revisited later on.</p>

<p>Custom CSS or Javascript enable customization of global style aspects of a project, and page level aspects of a project can be modified.</p>

<h2 id="book-users">Book Users</h2>

<p>You can add users to your book project so you can collaborate. Collaborators need to have their own Scalar account. Once they are registered, add them by selecting selecting <strong>Add User</strong>. Search for their name.</p>

<p>There are four different types of users: author, commentator, reviewer and reader.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Author: Full editing privileges.</li>
  <li>Commentator: Can edit existing pages, and create pages which will be flagged as commentaries to end users; no other editing privileges.</li>
  <li>Reviewer: Can edit existing pages; no other editing privileges.</li>
  <li>Reader: Can add signed comments to public pages; no other special privileges.</li>
</ul>
