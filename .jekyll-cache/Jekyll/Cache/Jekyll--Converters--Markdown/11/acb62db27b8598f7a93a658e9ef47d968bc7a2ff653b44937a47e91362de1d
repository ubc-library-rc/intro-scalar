<p>Scalar is a semantic digital publishing and exhibition platform that enables authors to create projects that emphasize and make use of different media resources. With minimal technical expertise, authors can create rich, visually-striking digital scholarship projects. Scalar enables authors to include media objects in their projects, link to media objects in institutional repositories, and to organize and present the online resources in a structured form. With Scalar, the author can organize pages and media resources in different ways that ‚Äútake advantage of the unique capabilities of digital writing, including nested, recursive, and non-linear formats‚Äù (Scalar) to communicate and support the narrative of the project.</p>

<p>The Scalar platform was produced by The Alliance for Networking Visual Culture at the University of Southern California (USC).</p>

<p>Unlike traditional research paper assignments, digital publishing assignments provide students with the opportunity to create content that can potentially reach a wider audience. Digital books can be made publicly available and even licensed with a Creative Commons license that allows them to be reused, redistributed, and adapted by other scholars.</p>

<p>Scalar has many built in features that make it ideal for digital and public pedagogy. For example, students can be added to a project as collaborators which means that students can work in groups or contribute to a project as a class. Scalar also integrates <a href="http://hypothes.is/">hypothes.is</a>, an annotation features that enables students and the public to annotate the contents of your book, making it easy for peer-review, feedback, and class discussion.</p>
